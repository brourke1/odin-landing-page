# odin-landing-page
Odin Project assignment for creating a specific webpage layout using HTML and CSS from scratch.

This project provided two example images (found under ./images folder) that specified what the website should like. The first image is a screenshot and the second
image provides the fonts and colors used in different sections of the webpage. Using this information, I recreated the webpage shown in the screenshot using HTML
and CSS. This was used as a way to test my knowledge.
